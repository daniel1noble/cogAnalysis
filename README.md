# Tutorial on Analysing Individual-Level Learning Data

This package is meant to be a very brief, but hopefully useful, tutorial on how one can make use of individual-level choice data to model learning rates. We also help users interpret the output from these models. Note that this is not a guide to all situations, and **does not** deal with every different experiment, but hopefully will aid in running and understanding models so that they can be applied (in possibly more advanced ways) to different learning experiments. You can make use of this guide along with the `cogdat`, which will help process longitudinal datasets that are useful when running experiments into vertical format for analysis.

You can download this package, or you can install it directly into R as follows:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(daniel1noble/cogAnalysis)

```
